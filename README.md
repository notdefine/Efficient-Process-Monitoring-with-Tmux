# Efficient-Process-Monitoring-with-Tmux

## A Bash script for monitoring multistep, long-running processes in real-time, with simultaneous progress display and full log capture.

This Bash script enables the efficient monitoring of multistep, long-running processes within a dual Tmux split-screen
setup. On one side, it visualizes the progress of the process through clearly structured messages, highlighting each
individual step. The other side logs all relevant output events in real-time, providing detailed information when
needed. The segregation of progress display and debug logs ensures users don't have to scroll through extensive log
outputs to monitor the process, while still retaining critical debug information. In the case of errors, the full log
history is available, ensuring that no important debug data is lost.
Key Features:

* Real-Time Progress Display: Displays each step of the process in the lower Tmux pane.
* Clear Stepwise Feedback: Color-coded messages indicating success, warning, or error states for each step.
* Separate Log Recording: Full, unabridged logs are captured in parallel, ready for debugging when necessary.
* Multi-Step Process Design: Supports complex workflows with multiple defined stages â€“ ideal for builds, tests, and
  deployments.

By using this tool, users gain an intuitive overview of the current status of multistep processes, without needing to
sift through logs continuously.
